    <h2>Description</h2>
    Banku is credited to the Ewe citizens living in the Volta region. Its name originated from the GaDangme language to
    refer to fermented corn and cassava dough. The areas along the Southeastern Ghanian coast also consume Banku the
    most.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb corn dough</li>
      <li>¼ lb cassava dough (or up to ½ lb)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup water (or up to 2 cups)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix together the corn and cassava dough with water until smooth, then transfer to high heat and stir
        continuously.</li>
      <li>Depending on how moist the processed dough was at the start, more water may be added so far as the consistency
        is solid,
        but not too firm.</li>
      <li>Turn the heat down to medium and allow the banku to steam in the pot, surrounded by 1 or 2 tablespoons of
        water. This
        should take 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>SGive the banku one final stir then take off the heat.</li>
      <li></li>To serve, scoop the desired amount into a wet bowl and swirl around until balls are formed.</li>
      <li>Banku may be served with okro stew, fante fante or grilled tilapia with shito..</li>

    </ol>
